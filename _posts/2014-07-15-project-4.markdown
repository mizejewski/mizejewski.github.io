description: <h6>Search Experience</h6><p>A current project is to improve search interface and results on the main library website. All groups of results must be visible at the same time. Currently, they appear in tabs, and users often miss the most important ones. So far, we have wireframes for a possible new search interface and results page. There is also a <a href="http://ucsf-ckm.github.io/search-results-prototype/search2.html">prototype</a> built with the Foundation framework showing how the new results would look in a responsive environment. </p><p><img class="img-centered" src="img/04search-results.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="700"></p><p><img class="img-centered" src="img/04search-interface.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="700"></p>
