description: <h6>Personas and User Tasks</h6><p>Keeping with the theme of being sure we know what our audience(s) need from the library, I drove efforts to capture some of their tasks and possible frustrations. <a href="https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/x/fIPbEw">Personas</a> and information were developed via brainstorming and discussions with a cross section of staff who serve various populations, as well as from talking with students.  </p>
