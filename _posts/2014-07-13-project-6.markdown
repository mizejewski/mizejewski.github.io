description: <h6>Study Spaces</h6><p><a href="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/services/spaces">Currently</a> we just list study spaces and leave users to wade through them. The goal sketched out in wireframe is to offer an better interface where the user can check off certain criteria and get back a short list of spaces that meet their needs in the moment. I was able to quickly generate a series of wireframes incorporating feedback and arriving at the final content in the course of a few days. </p><p><img class="img-centered" src="img/06study_wire1_750_943.jpg" alt="" height="1006" width="750"></p><p><img class="img-centered" src="img/06study_wire2_750_1164.jpg" alt="" height="1164" width="750"></p>
